Tool:    bedtools sample (aka sampleFile)
Summary: Take sample of input file(s) using reservoir sampling algorithm.

Usage:   bedtools sample [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf/bam>

WARNING:	The current sample algorithm will hold all requested sample records in memory prior to output.
		The user must ensure that there is adequate memory for this.

Options: 
	-n	The number of records to generate.
		- Default = 1,000,000.
		- (INTEGER)

	-seed	Supply an integer seed for the shuffling.
		- By default, the seed is chosen automatically.
		- (INTEGER)

	-ubam	Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.

	-bed	When using BAM input (-abam), write output as BED. The default
		is to write output in BAM when using -abam.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only give records
		that have the same strand. Use '-s forward' or '-s reverse'
		for forward or reverse strand records, respectively.
		- By default, records are reported without respect to strand.

	-header	Print the header from the input file prior to results.
